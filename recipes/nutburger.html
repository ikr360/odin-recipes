    <h1>The Nutburger</h1>
    <img src="images/nutburger.jpg" alt="nutburger" height="400" width="400">
    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Nuts work so well on a burger because they are salty and contain
        tasty oils. What nuts add, in addition, is a texture that is unlike any other
        food out there.</p>
        <p> Bacon and crisp lettuce can contribute a nice crunchy
        texture to a hamburger, but it’s hard to find anything to match the
        mouthfeel of nuts.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>150g roasted salted peanuts (without shells or skins)</li>
            <li>120ml of mayonnaise mixed with 2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>neutral oil</li>
            <li>1kg fresh-ground meat</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>soft white buns, toasted</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Shortly before you cook the burgers, crush the peanuts by laying them
                out on a cutting board or butcher block and covering them with a clean
                kitchen cloth. Smash with a mallet or rolling pin until the peanuts are
                crumbled (if you’ve made a powder, you’ve gone too far).</li>
            <li>Mix the crushed peanuts with the mayonnaise in the
                small mixing bowl until combined. The topping should have a relatively
                thick consistency. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the cast-iron skillet over medium heat and add a drop or two
                of peanut oil to coat the surface.</li>
            <li>Place the ground chuck in the medium mixing bowl and use the salad
                scoop to make balls of beef, placing them in the skillet as you go.</li>
            <li>Add a generous pinch of salt to each ball of beef and, using the stiff
                spatula, press them down hard. Once flat, don’t touch them again. Let
                cook for 2½ minutes or until reddish liquid begins to form on the surface
                of the patties.</li>
            <li>Flip them once, and resist the temptation to press them again. Cook
                for another 2 minutes or until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Transfer the patties to the toasted buns and top with a heaping
                spoonful of the peanut condiment followed by the top bun. Serve
                immediately.</li>                        
        </ol>
