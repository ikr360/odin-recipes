    <h1>The Guberburger</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>The Guberburger wins
        converts though, usually the ones with an open mind who are unafraid of
        complex flavors.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has eaten Thai food and other tasty treats
        from Southeast Asia knows that the peanut plays a vital role in the
        cuisine. Beef satay, grilled beef on skewers accompanied by a peanut
        dipping sauce, is not far from the experience of the Guberburger.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>neutral oil</li>
        <li>1kg fresh-ground meat</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>240ml creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>soft white buns</li>
        <li>dill pickle chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the cast-iron skillet over medium heat (or a flat top to
                medium) and add a drop or two of peanut oil. Use the spatula to spread
                the oil, coating the cooking surface.</li>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a mixing bowl and, using the salad scoop,
                form balls of beef, placing them on the heated skillet as you go.</li>
            <li>Add a generous pinch of salt to each ball of beef and then, using the
                stiff spatula, press them down hard until they become wide patties just a
                bit larger than the buns. Let them cook, undisturbed, for 2½ minutes or
                until reddish liquid begins to form on the surface of the patties.</li>
            <li>As soon as the patties are smashed, heat the peanut butter in the small
                saucepan over low heat.</li>
            <li>When they’re ready, flip each patty once and don’t press them again.
                Spoon some of the warm peanut butter over the patties and cook for
                another 2 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add 2 or 3 pickle chips to each bottom bun and set aside.</li>
            <li>When the patties are cooked though, remove them from the heat and
                place them on the prepared toasted buns. Serve with pride.</li>                    
        </ol>
